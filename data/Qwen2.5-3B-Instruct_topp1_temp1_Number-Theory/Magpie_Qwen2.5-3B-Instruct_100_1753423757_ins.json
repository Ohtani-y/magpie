    "instruction": "What is Wilson's theorem and how can it be proven? Wilson's theorem states that for a prime number p, (p-1)! \u2261 -1 (mod p) if and only if p is a prime number. It can be proven using properties of modular arithmetic, order of elements, and Fermat's Little Theorem. Given a prime p, consider the multiset of numbers {1,2,...,p-1} modulo p. Each nonzero residue modulo p has an inverse, and the inverses form a second multiset. By order considerations and well-ordering, we show that for some integer x in the original multiset, x^(p-1) \u2261 1 (mod p) if and only if x^(p-2) \u2261 -1 (mod p). Thus, (p-1)! = (-1)^((p-2)/2) * (p-1)! \u2261 -1 (mod p). For nonprimes, (p-1)! is always divisible by p due to Fermat's Little Theorem, making the congruence false. This elegant result connects factorials to primes in a non-intuitive way, highlighting the importance of primes in number theory. For a specific example, prove that 11 is a prime number by applying Wilson's theorem. To prove that 11 is a prime number using Wilson's theorem, we will apply the theorem to p = 11.
