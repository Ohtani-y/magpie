    "instruction": "Okay, so I'm having trouble understanding how to find the area under a curve. Can you walk me through the basic process? Let's say we have a function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) and we want to find the area under this curve from \\( x=0 \\) to \\( x=1 \\). How would we do that? <|begin_body|>Certainly! To find the area under the curve of the function \\( f(x) = x^2 \\) from \\( x=0 \\) to \\( x=1 \\), we need to evaluate the definite integral of \\( f(x) \\) over the interval \\([0, 1]\\). The definite integral of a function \\( f(x) \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( b \\) represents the signed area between the curve and the x-axis over that interval, with positive areas above the x-axis and negative areas below it.",
