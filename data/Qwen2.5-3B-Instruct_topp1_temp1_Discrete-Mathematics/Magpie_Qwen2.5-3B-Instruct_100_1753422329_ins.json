    "instruction": "In a mathematics competition, there are 40 participants. Each participant is given a unique integer from 1 to 40. The competition consists of a round-robin format where every participant plays a game against every other participant exactly once. In each game, the stronger player (by the integer assigned) wins. There can be ties if the integers are the same. Calculate the total number of games played in the competition. To determine the total number of games played in the round-robin format where each participant plays every other participant exactly once, we can use the concept of combinations. Specifically, we need to find the number of ways to choose 2 participants out of 40 to play a game, denoted as \\( \\binom{40}{2} \\).",

How should one approach this type of problem? To solve the problem of finding the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word \"COMBINATION\" such that the letters 'M' and 'N' are not together, we can use a counting method based on complementary counting. This means we will first calculate the total number of arrangements and then subtract the number of arrangements where 'M' and 'N' are together.",
