    "instruction": "Democratic Peace Theory and Peace Operations: A Mathematical Explanation",
    "response": "The Democratic Peace Theory (DPT) posits that democracies are less likely to engage in war with each other. This theory has been a subject of extensive research and debate in political science, international relations, and other fields. While the theory is often discussed in qualitative terms, it can be explored through mathematical models to provide a more structured and analytical approach.\n\n### Democratic Peace Theory\n\nThe DPT suggests that democratic states are less likely to go to war with each other. This is often attributed to factors such as the spread of democratic norms, the presence of civil society, and the ability of democratic institutions to manage conflicts peacefully. However, the theory is not without its critics, who argue that it is too simplistic and does not account for all the factors that influence state behavior.\n\n### Mathematical Models\n\nTo explore the DPT mathematically, we can consider a simplified model where we represent states as nodes in a network and the likelihood of war between two states as a function of their political characteristics. Let's denote the probability of war between two states \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) as \\(P_{ij}\\).\n\n#### Variables and Parameters\n\n1. **Democracy Level**: We can represent the democracy level of a state as a continuous variable \\(D_i\\) for state \\(i\\), where \\(D_i\\) ranges from 0 (least democratic) to 1 (most democratic).\n2. **Distance in the Network**: The distance between two states in a network can be represented as \\(D_{ij}\\), which could be a measure of the number of intermediary states between \\(i\\) and \\(j\\).\n3. **War Probability Function**: The probability of war can be modeled as a function of these variables, such as \\(P_{ij} = f(D_i, D_j, D_{ij})\\).\n\n#### Simplified Model\n\nA simple model might be:\n\\[ P_{ij} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\alpha D_i + \\beta D_j + \\gamma D_{ij})}} \\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), and \\(\\gamma\\) are parameters that control the influence of democracy level and distance on the likelihood of war.\n\n### Interpretation\n\n- **Democracy Level (\\(D_i\\))**: Higher democracy levels (\\(D_i\\) closer to 1) are associated with lower war probabilities.\n- **Distance (\\(D_{ij}\\))**: Higher distances (\\(D_{ij}\\) larger) are associated with higher war probabilities, as intermediary states can act as buffers or disrupt peace.\n- **Interaction Terms**: The interaction terms \\(\\alpha D_i\\), \\(\\beta D_j\\), and \\(\\gamma D_{ij}\\) capture the combined effect of democracy levels and distance on the likelihood of war.\n\n### Empirical Validation\n\nTo validate this model, empirical data on war occurrences and democracy levels can be used. For instance, data from the Correlates of War project can be analyzed to see how well the model predicts actual war occurrences.\n\n### Extensions\n\n- **Complex Network Models**: Real-world networks are often more complex than simple linear models. Incorporating features like network centrality, structural holes, and other network properties can provide a more nuanced understanding.\n- **Dynamic Models**: Considering the evolution of democracy and war over time can help in understanding the long-term trends and the impact of various factors.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWhile the Democratic Peace Theory is a valuable framework for understanding international relations, it can be enriched with mathematical models to provide a more structured and predictive approach. By using mathematical tools, we can better understand the complex interplay of democracy, distance, and other factors that influence the likelihood of war between states.",

    "response": "To simplify the quadratic equation \\(\\frac{8}{5}x^2 + x - \\frac{8}{15} = 0\\) by multiplying every term by the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators, we first identify the denominators, which are 5 and 15. The LCM of 5 and 15 is 15. Therefore, we multiply every term in the equation by 15:\n\n\\[\n15 \\left( \\frac{8}{5}x^2 + x - \\frac{8}{15} \\right) = 15 \\cdot 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n15 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}x^2 + 15 \\cdot x - 15 \\cdot \\frac{8}{15} = 0\n\\]\n\nSimplifying each term, we get:\n\n\\[\n3 \\cdot 8x^2 + 15x - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis further simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n24x^2 + 15x - 8 = 0\n\\]\n\nNow, we solve the quadratic equation \\(24x^2 + 15x - 8 = 0\\) by completing the square. First, we divide the entire equation by 24 to simplify the coefficients:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{15}{24}x - \\frac{8}{24} = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{5}{8}x - \\frac{1}{3} = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we move the constant term to the other side of the equation:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{5}{8}x = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\nTo complete the square, we need to add and subtract the square of half the coefficient of \\(x\\). The coefficient of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{8}\\), so half of this is \\(\\frac{5}{16}\\), and its square is \\(\\left(\\frac{5}{16}\\right)^2 = \\frac{25}{256}\\). Adding and subtracting \\(\\frac{25}{256}\\) inside the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + \\frac{5}{8}x + \\frac{25}{256} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{25}{256}\n\\]\n\nThe left side is now a perfect square:\n\n\\[\n\\left(x + \\frac{5}{16}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{25}{256}\n\\]\n\nTo add the fractions on the right side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 3 and 256 is 768. So, we convert \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) to \\(\\frac{256}{768}\\) and \\(\\frac{25}{256}\\) to \\(\\frac{75}{768}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\left(x + \\frac{5}{16}\\right)^2 = \\frac{256}{768} + \\frac{75}{768} = \\frac{331}{768}\n\\]\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{5}{16} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{331}{768}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{331}}{\\sqrt{768}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{331}}{16\\sqrt{3}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{331} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{48} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{993}}{48}\n\\]\n\nSo, we have:\n\n\\[\nx = -\\frac{5}{16} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{993}}{48}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-5 \\cdot 3 + \\sqrt{993}}{48} = \\frac{-15 + \\sqrt{993}}{48}\n\\]\nand\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-5 \\cdot 3 - \\sqrt{993}}{48} = \\frac{-15 - \\sqrt{993}}{48}\n\\]\n\nSo the solutions are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{-15 + \\sqrt{993}}{48}, \\frac{-15 - \\sqrt{993}}{48}}\n\\]",

The factors of \\(-3\\) are \\(\\pm 1, \\pm 3\\), and the factors of \\(1\\) are \\(\\pm 1\\).

    "response": "To find the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the equation \\( 12x^4 + 11x^3 + 13x^2 + 12x + 11 = n \\) has at least one real root, we need to analyze the function \\( f(x) = 12x^4 + 11x^3 + 13x^2 + 12x + 11 \\) and determine the range of values it can take.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate \\( f(x) \\) at some specific points to get an idea of its behavior.\n\n1. Evaluate \\( f(0) \\):\n\\[\nf(0) = 12(0)^4 + 11(0)^3 + 13(0)^2 + 12(0) + 11 = 11\n\\]\n\n2. Evaluate \\( f(-1) \\):\n\\[\nf(-1) = 12(-1)^4 + 11(-1)^3 + 13(-1)^2 + 12(-1) + 11 = 12 - 11 + 13 - 12 + 11 = 13\n\\]\n\n3. Evaluate \\( f(1) \\):\n\\[\nf(1) = 12(1)^4 + 11(1)^3 + 13(1)^2 + 12(1) + 11 = 12 + 11 + 13 + 12 + 11 = 59\n\\]\n\nFrom these evaluations, we see that:\n\\[\nf(0) = 11 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(1) = 59\n\\]\n\nSince \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial of degree 4, it is continuous and differentiable everywhere. We need to check if \\( f(x) \\) can take values between 11 and 59. To do this, we can analyze the derivative \\( f'(x) \\) to understand the behavior of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nThe derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[\nf'(x) = 48x^3 + 33x^2 + 26x + 12\n\\]\n\nTo find the critical points, we solve \\( f'(x) = 0 \\):\n\\[\n48x^3 + 33x^2 + 26x + 12 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a cubic equation, and finding its roots analytically can be complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots. For simplicity, let's check the sign of \\( f'(x) \\) to understand the behavior of \\( f(x) \\).\n\nSince \\( f'(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, it can have up to three real roots. We can test some values to see if \\( f'(x) \\) changes sign, indicating a local maximum or minimum.\n\nLet's evaluate \\( f'(x) \\) at some points:\n\\[\nf'(-1) = 48(-1)^3 + 33(-1)^2 + 26(-1) + 12 = -48 + 33 - 26 + 12 = -39\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(0) = 48(0)^3 + 33(0)^2 + 26(0) + 12 = 12\n\\]\n\\[\nf'(1) = 48(1)^3 + 33(1)^2 + 26(1) + 12 = 48 + 33 + 26 + 12 = 120\n\\]\n\nFrom these evaluations, we see that \\( f'(x) \\) changes sign between \\( x = -1 \\) and \\( x = 0 \\), indicating a local minimum at some point in this interval. This suggests that \\( f(x) \\) has a local minimum value between 11 and 59.\n\nTo confirm, we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem, which states that if a continuous function takes values \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) at points \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), respectively, and \\( f(a) < f(b) \\), then it must take any value between \\( f(a) \\) and \\( f(b) \\) at some point in the interval \\([a, b]\\).\n\nSince \\( f(0) = 11 \\) and \\( f(1) = 59 \\), and \\( f(x) \\) is continuous, it must take all values between 11 and 59. Therefore, the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( f(x) = n \\) has at least one real root is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",

The hypotenuse \\(c\\) of a right triangle with legs \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \\]\n\nGiven \\(a = 5\\) and \\(b = 12\\), we can substitute these values into the formula:\n\n\\[ c = \\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{25 + 144} = \\sqrt{169} = 13 \\]\n\nSo, the hypotenuse of the original right triangle is 13.

Let's take a specific example to illustrate the process. \n\nFor instance, let's solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\).\n\n### Step 1: Identify the coefficients\nIn the equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\), the coefficients are:\n- \\(a = 1\\)\n- \\(b = -5\\)\n- \\(c = 6\\)\n\n### Step 2: Factor the quadratic expression\nWe need to find two numbers that multiply to \\(c\\) (which is 6) and add up to \\(b\\) (which is -5). These numbers are -2 and -3 because:\n- \\((-2) \\times (-3) = 6\\)\n- \\((-2) + (-3) = -5\\)\n\nSo, we can rewrite the quadratic expression as:\n\\[x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)\\]\n\n### Step 3: Set each factor equal to zero\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero:\n\\[\nx - 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 3 = 0\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Solve for \\(x\\)\nSolving these equations gives:\n\\[\nx = 2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = 3\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe solutions to the quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\\) are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{x = 2 \\text{ or } x = 3}\n\\]\n\nIf you have a different quadratic equation, please provide it, and I'll solve it for you following the same steps.",

    "response": "To solve the inequality \\(\\frac{2}{x+1} \\geq 0\\), we need to determine when the fraction is non-negative. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n1. **Identify the critical points**: The critical points are the values of \\(x\\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. In this case, the numerator is 2, which is never zero, and the denominator is \\(x+1\\), which is zero when \\(x = -1\\). So, \\(x = -1\\) is a critical point.\n\n2. **Determine the sign of the expression in each interval**: The critical point \\(x = -1\\) divides the number line into two intervals: \\((-\\infty, -1)\\) and \\((-1, \\infty)\\). We need to test the sign of \\(\\frac{2}{x+1}\\) in each of these intervals.\n\n   - For \\(x \\in (-\\infty, -1)\\), choose a test point, say \\(x = -2\\). Then \\(\\frac{2}{-2+1} = \\frac{2}{-1} = -2\\), which is negative.\n   - For \\(x \\in (-1, \\infty)\\), choose a test point, say \\(x = 0\\). Then \\(\\frac{2}{0+1} = \\frac{2}{1} = 2\\), which is positive.\n\n3. **Consider the critical point**: At \\(x = -1\\), the expression \\(\\frac{2}{x+1}\\) is undefined because the denominator is zero. Therefore, \\(x = -1\\) is not included in the solution set.\n\n4. **Combine the results**: The expression \\(\\frac{2}{x+1}\\) is non-negative in the interval \\((-1, \\infty)\\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \\(\\frac{2}{x+1} \\geq 0\\) is \\((-1, \\infty)\\).\n\nThe solution set in interval notation is \\((-1, \\infty)\\).\n\nTo graph this on the number line, we draw a number line and place an open circle at \\(-1\\) (since \\(-1\\) is not included) and a closed circle at \\(0\\) (since \\(0\\) is included) and shade the interval between them.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-1, \\infty)}\n\\]",

Therefore, the discounted cost for each person is:\n\\[ 17 \\times 0.90 = 15.30 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for all 10 friends\n\nSince there are 10 friends, the total cost for all of them is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 15.30 = 153.00 \\]\n\n### Summary\n\n- Each person spent $15.30 in total.\n- The total cost for all the friends is $153.00.\n\nThus, each person spent $15.30, and the total cost for all the friends is $153.00.",

The formula works by finding the values of \\(x\\) that make the quadratic expression equal to zero. The term under the square root, \\(b^2 - 4ac\\), is called the discriminant. It determines the nature of the roots:\n- If \\(\\Delta > 0\\), there are two distinct real roots.\n- If \\(\\Delta = 0\\), there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n- If \\(\\Delta < 0\\), there are two complex roots.\n\nIn this case, \\(\\Delta = 9 > 0\\), so we have two distinct real roots.",

    "response": "To solve the equation \\(\\frac{2}{x-1} - \\frac{1}{x+1} = \\frac{x+2}{x^2-1}\\), we will follow these steps:\n\n1. **Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:**\n   Notice that \\(x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)\\). So, we can rewrite the right-hand side as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x+2}{x^2-1} = \\frac{x+2}{(x-1)(x+1)}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Combine the fractions on the left-hand side:**\n   To combine the fractions on the left-hand side, we need a common denominator, which is \\((x-1)(x+1)\\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{x-1} - \\frac{1}{x+1} = \\frac{2(x+1) - 1(x-1)}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{2x + 2 - x + 1}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{x + 3}{(x-1)(x+1)}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set the simplified left-hand side equal to the simplified right-hand side:**\n   Now we have:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{x + 3}{(x-1)(x+1)} = \\frac{x + 2}{(x-1)(x+1)}\n   \\]\n   Since the denominators are the same, we can equate the numerators:\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = x + 2\n   \\]\n   Subtract \\(x\\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3 = 2\n   \\]\n   This is a contradiction, which means there are no values of \\(x\\) that satisfy the equation.\n\n4. **Check the domain of the original equation:**\n   The original equation is undefined for \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\) because these values make the denominators zero. Since our solution \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\) do not satisfy the equation, we need to check if there are any other values that might satisfy the equation. However, as we have shown, the equation simplifies to a contradiction, so there are no solutions.\n\nTherefore, the solution to the equation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{No solution}}\n\\]",

    "response": "Sure, let's solve the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\\) using both methods.\n\n### Method 1: Using the Quadratic Formula\n\nThe quadratic formula is given by:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nwhere \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\).\n\nFor the equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\\), we have:\n\\[\na = 2, \\quad b = -5, \\quad c = 3\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate the discriminant \\(\\Delta\\):\n\\[\n\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 25 - 24 = 1\n\\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(\\Delta\\) into the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{5 \\pm 1}{4}\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[\nx_1 = \\frac{5 + 1}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx_2 = \\frac{5 - 1}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions using the quadratic formula are:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1\n\\]\n\n### Method 2: Factoring\n\nTo factor the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\\), we need to find two binomials whose product equals the given quadratic expression. We look for two numbers that multiply to \\(ac = 2 \\cdot 3 = 6\\) and add up to \\(b = -5\\).\n\nThe pairs of factors of 6 are:\n\\[\n(1, 6), \\quad (-1, -6), \\quad (2, 3), \\quad (-2, -3)\n\\]\n\nWe need the pair that adds up to \\(-5\\). The pair \\((-2, -3)\\) works because:\n\\[\n-2 + (-3) = -5\n\\]\n\nNow, we rewrite the middle term \\(-5x\\) using these factors:\n\\[\n2x^2 - 2x - 3x + 3 = 0\n\\]\n\nNext, we group the terms and factor by grouping:\n\\[\n(2x^2 - 2x) + (-3x + 3) = 0\n\\]\n\nFactor out the greatest common factor from each group:\n\\[\n2x(x - 1) - 3(x - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nNotice that \\((x - 1)\\) is a common factor:\n\\[\n(2x - 3)(x - 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nSet each factor equal to zero to find the solutions:\n\\[\n2x - 3 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x - 1 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving these equations:\n\\[\n2x - 3 = 0 \\implies 2x = 3 \\implies x = \\frac{3}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nx - 1 = 0 \\implies x = 1\n\\]\n\nSo, the solutions using factoring are:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{3}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 1\n\\]\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth methods yield the same solutions:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2} \\text{ and } 1}\n\\]",

This means we substitute \\(g(x)\\) into \\(f(x)\\).\n\nGiven:\n\\[ f(x) = 3x + 2 \\]\n\\[ g(x) = x^2 \\]\n\nSo,\n\\[ f(g(x)) = f(x^2) \\]\nSubstitute \\(x^2\\) into \\(f(x)\\):\n\\[ f(x^2) = 3(x^2) + 2 = 3x^2 + 2 \\]\n\nThus,\n\\[ (f \\circ g)(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Find the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\)\nThe domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is the set of all \\(x\\) for which \\(g(x)\\) is defined and the result is in the domain of \\(f(x)\\). Since \\(g(x) = x^2\\) is defined for all real numbers and \\(f(x) = 3x + 2\\) is also defined for all real numbers, the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the domain of \\((f \\circ g)(x)\\) is:\n\\[ (-\\infty, \\infty) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Find \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\)\nThe composite function \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) is defined as \\(g(f(x))\\).

Since \\(f(x) = 3x + 2\\) is defined for all real numbers and \\(g(x) = x^2\\) is defined for all real numbers, the domain of \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) is all real numbers.\n\nTherefore, the domain of \\((g \\circ f)(x)\\) is:\n\\[ (-\\infty, \\infty) \\]\n\n### Final Answer\nThe composite functions and their domains are:\n\\[ (f \\circ g)(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Domain of } (f \\circ g)(x) = (-\\infty, \\infty) \\]\n\\[ (g \\circ f)(x) = (3x + 2)^2 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Domain of } (g \\circ f)(x) = (-\\infty, \\infty) \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{(f \\circ g)(x) = 3x^2 + 2, \\text{ domain } (-\\infty, \\infty); (g \\circ f)(x) = (3x + 2)^2, \\text{ domain } (-\\infty, \\infty)} \\]",

Let's substitute these values into the quadratic formula.\n\nFirst, calculate the discriminant:\n\n\\[b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(2)(3) = 25 - 24 = 1\\]\n\nNow, substitute \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and the discriminant into the quadratic formula:\n\n\\[x = \\frac{-(-5) \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2(2)} = \\frac{5 \\pm 1}{4}\\]\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{5 + 1}{4} = \\frac{6}{4} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\]\n\n\\[x_2 = \\frac{5 - 1}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1\\]\n\nSo, the roots of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\\) are \\(x = 1.5\\) and \\(x = 1\\).\n\nExpressing the roots in exact form, we have:\n\n\\[x_1 = \\frac{3}{2}\\]\n\\[x_2 = 1\\]\n\nApproximating these roots to three decimal places, we get:\n\n\\[x_1 \\approx 1.500\\]\n\\[x_2 \\approx 1.000\\]\n\nTherefore, the roots of the quadratic equation \\(2x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0\\) are \\(x = \\frac{3}{2}\\) and \\(x = 1\\), or approximately \\(x \\approx 1.500\\) and \\(x \\approx 1.000\\).",

    "response": "Certainly! Let's solve the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) by factoring, and then we'll verify the solutions. We'll also discuss the graphical representation and the nature of the roots based on the discriminant.\n\n### Step 1: Factoring the Quadratic Equation\n\nTo factor the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\), we need to find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term (6) and add up to give the coefficient of the linear term (5).\n\nThe numbers that satisfy these conditions are 2 and 3, because:\n\\[ 2 \\times 3 = 6 \\]\n\\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, we can factor the quadratic equation as:\n\\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solving the Factored Equation\n\nNow, we set each factor equal to zero to find the roots:\n\\[ (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 \\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\\[ x + 2 = 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x + 3 = 0 \\]\n\nSolving these equations:\n\\[ x = -2 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = -3 \\]\n\nSo, the solutions to the quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) are:\n\\[ x = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = -3 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Verification\n\nTo verify, we substitute \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\) back into the original equation:\n\\[ (-2)^2 + 5(-2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 \\]\n\\[ (-3)^2 + 5(-3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 \\]\n\nBoth values satisfy the equation, confirming our solutions.\n\n### Step 4: Graphical Representation\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) can be represented in the form \\(y = ax^2 + bx + c\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 5\\), and \\(c = 6\\). The vertex form of a quadratic equation is \\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex.\n\nFirst, we find the vertex using the formula \\(h = -\\frac{b}{2a}\\):\n\\[ h = -\\frac{5}{2 \\cdot 1} = -\\frac{5}{2} = -2.5 \\]\n\nNext, we find the y-coordinate of the vertex by substituting \\(h\\) back into the equation:\n\\[ k = a(h)^2 + b(h) + c \\]\n\\[ k = 1(-2.5)^2 + 5(-2.5) + 6 \\]\n\\[ k = 1(6.25) - 12.5 + 6 \\]\n\\[ k = 6.25 - 12.5 + 6 \\]\n\\[ k = -0.25 \\]\n\nSo, the vertex is at \\((-2.5, -0.25)\\).\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(y = x^2 + 5x + 6\\) can be rewritten in vertex form:\n\\[ y = (x + 2.5)^2 - 0.25 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Nature of the Roots Based on the Discriminant\n\nThe discriminant \\(\\Delta\\) of a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \\]\n\nFor our equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\):\n\\[ a = 1, \\quad b = 5, \\quad c = 6 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 5^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 25 - 24 \\]\n\\[ \\Delta = 1 \\]\n\nSince \\(\\Delta > 0\\), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\\) has roots \\(x = -2\\) and \\(x = -3\\). The vertex of the parabola represented by the equation is at \\((-2.5, -0.25)\\), and the nature of the roots is that they are two distinct real roots.",

    "response": "To find the domain and range of the function \\( f(x) = \\log_2(x^2 - 4x + 9) \\), we need to analyze the expression inside the logarithm and the properties of the logarithmic function.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the Domain\nThe domain of the function \\( f(x) = \\log_2(x^2 - 4x + 9) \\) is the set of all \\( x \\) for which the argument of the logarithm, \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\), is positive. Since \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\) is a quadratic expression, we need to check if it can ever be zero or negative.\n\nFirst, we find the minimum value of the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\). We can complete the square:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 9 = (x^2 - 4x + 4) + 5 = (x-2)^2 + 5.\n\\]\nSince \\((x-2)^2 \\geq 0\\) for all \\( x \\), it follows that \\((x-2)^2 + 5 \\geq 5\\). Therefore, the minimum value of \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\) is 5, which is always positive. This means that \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 > 0 \\) for all real numbers \\( x \\).\n\nThus, the domain of \\( f(x) \\) is all real numbers, or in interval notation:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(-\\infty, \\infty)}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Range\nNext, we need to find the range of the function \\( f(x) = \\log_2(x^2 - 4x + 9) \\). Since the argument of the logarithm, \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\), is always at least 5, we have:\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x + 9 \\geq 5.\n\\]\nTaking the logarithm base 2 of both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\log_2(x^2 - 4x + 9) \\geq \\log_2(5).\n\\]\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( f(x) \\) is \\( \\log_2(5) \\). As \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\) can take any value greater than or equal to 5, \\( f(x) \\) can take any value greater than or equal to \\( \\log_2(5) \\). There is no upper bound to \\( f(x) \\) because \\( x^2 - 4x + 9 \\) can be arbitrarily large.\n\nThus, the range of \\( f(x) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{[\\log_2(5), \\infty)}\n\\]",
