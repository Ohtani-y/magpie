    "instruction": "Using the principles of the Chinese Remainder Theorem, determine how many possible remainders there are when 16 different positive integers are divided by 7, such that each remainder is unique. To solve this problem using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), we need to think about the unique remainders we can obtain when dividing 16 different positive integers by 7, ensuring each remainder is used only once. The possible remainders when any integer is divided by 7 range from 0 to 6, or in other words, the remainders can be any integer in the set \\(\\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}\\). Since we need exactly 16 different positive integers such that each remainder is unique, and there are only 7 possible remainders, it means we must overlap or include the same remainder multiple times to fill the 16 spots.",

Finding such groups of three prime numbers that sum up to a perfect square is indeed a fascinating area of research in number theory, and it connects deeply to the distribution of prime numbers and the exploration of their properties within number theoretic frameworks.",

    "instruction": "Prove that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (i.e., every integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization). Please use strong induction to prove this statement. Here, the product in the definition of prime factorization is understood as a representation of the integer as the product of primes, not as a sum of primes. Thus, 2 is a product with one factor, and 6 = 2 * 3 is a product with two factors. A product ends with a final prime greater than 3 being disqualified, as such a prime factor would saturate the volume of its lower designated singleton half prime compositions in series recursion, hence there can be only one such singleton half prime factor.
