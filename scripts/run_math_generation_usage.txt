# Usage Guide for run_math_generation.sh

## Interactive Mode (default)
./run_math_generation.sh

## Non-Interactive Mode with Arguments

### Format:
./run_math_generation.sh <model_choice> <scale> <mode_choice> [domain_choice]

### Examples:

1. Generate all domains using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B at 10% scale:
   ./run_math_generation.sh 1 0.1 1
   # Model 1 = DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B
   # Scale 0.1 = 10% of default (4.4K problems total)
   # Mode 1 = All Domains

2. Generate algebra problems using Qwen2.5-Math-72B at full scale:
   ./run_math_generation.sh 5 1.0 2 1
   # Model 5 = Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct
   # Scale 1.0 = 100% (10K problems)
   # Mode 2 = Single Domain
   # Domain 1 = Algebra

3. Generate all domains using test model at 50% scale:
   ./run_math_generation.sh 8 0.5 1
   # Model 8 = Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Test model)
   # Scale 0.5 = 50% of default (22K problems total)
   # Mode 1 = All Domains

### Model Choices:
1 = DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (Recommended - Balanced performance)
2 = DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B (High performance - Requires A100)
3 = DeepSeek-R1-0528-FP4 (Memory efficient - FP4 quantized)
4 = Gemma-3-27B-it (Google model)
5 = Qwen2.5-Math-72B-Instruct (Math specialist)
6 = Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct (Computational math focus)
8 = Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (Test model - Lightweight)

### Scale Options:
0.1 = 10% of default (Small - for testing)
0.5 = 50% of default (Medium - for development)
1.0 = 100% of default (Large - standard)
2.0 = 200% of default (Extra Large - comprehensive)
Note: Problem counts are rounded to nearest 10

### Mode Choices:
1 = All Domains - Generate complete dataset with scale applied
2 = Single Domain - Generate problems for one specific math domain
3 = Custom Selection - Choose multiple domains interactively (interactive mode only)

### Domain Choices (for mode 2):
1 = Algebra (10K default)
2 = Calculus (10K default)
3 = Geometry (6K default)
4 = Statistics (6K default)
5 = Number Theory (4K default)
6 = Discrete Mathematics (8K default)
